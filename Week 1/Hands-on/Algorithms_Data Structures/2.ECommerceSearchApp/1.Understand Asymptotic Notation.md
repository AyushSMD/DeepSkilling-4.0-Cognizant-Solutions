## 1.	Understand Asymptotic Notation: 

### Big O Notation:
- Big O notation describes the _upper bound_ of an algorithm's running time.
- It gives a high-level understanding of the **performance or complexity.**
- It helps us _compare_ how algorithms scale as input size grows.

#### Scenarios:

| **Scenario**   | **Description**                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | 
| Best Case      | Minimum work needed (e.g., finding first element).  |
| Average Case   | Expected time on random data.                       |
| Worst Case     | Maximum work needed (e.g., element not found).      |
