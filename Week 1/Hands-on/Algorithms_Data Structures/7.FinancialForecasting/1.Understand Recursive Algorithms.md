## Understand Recursive Algorithms

**Definition:**
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem until a base case is reached.

**Analogy:**
Imagine a set of nested boxes. You open a box, and inside it is another box. You keep opening boxes until you find the smallest one, which has the answer. That smallest box is the base case.

**In forecasting:**
If we know the value today and the growth rate, we can calculate tomorrow’s value based on today’s, and repeat that for the number of days (or years) into the future.
