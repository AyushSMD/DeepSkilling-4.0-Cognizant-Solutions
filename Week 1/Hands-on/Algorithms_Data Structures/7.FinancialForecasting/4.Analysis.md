## Time Complexity Analysis
Let’s analyze the recursive method:
```
PredictFutureValue(pv, gr, years - 1)
```
- It makes 1 recursive call per year, so for n years → **O(n)** time complexity.
- Each call returns a constant-time multiplication → linear complexity.

## Optimization: Convert to Iterative or Use Memoization
Although this recursion is simple and not deeply nested, here are ways to optimize:

### 1. Iterative Version (Better for performance)
```
public static double PredictFutureValueIterative(double presentValue, double growthRate, int years)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < years; i++)
    {
        presentValue *= (1 + growthRate);
    }
    return presentValue;
}
```
### 2. Memoization (Not essential here, but useful for complex trees)
If you calculate many overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci), store results in a dictionary to avoid re-computation.
